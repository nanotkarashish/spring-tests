= Overview

This example demonstrates how you can get started with Spring REST Docs. You will learn to:

* Generate your API documentation from an Asciidoc document.
* Document the behavior of your REST API by using Spring REST Docs and Spring MVC Test.
* Include the API documentation created by Spring REST docs in your Asciidoc document.

[[resources-say-hello]]
== Say Hello

We can obtain a message from our REST API by sending a `GET` request to
the path: `/api/hello`. The following example demonstrates how we can send this HTTP request by using curl:

include::{snippets}/say-hello/curl-request.adoc[]

When we send this `GET` request, our REST API returns the HTTP status 200 and the message: 'Hello World!' back to us.
The returned HTTP response looks as follows:

include::{snippets}/say-hello/http-response.adoc[]

[[resources-create-message]]
== Create Message

We can create a new message by sending a `POST` request to the path: `/api/message`. When we create
a new message, we have to add the information of the created message to the request body.

The JSON document that specifies the information of the created message looks as follows:

include::{snippets}/create-message-success/request-body.adoc[]

After our REST API has processed the incoming HTTP request, it identifies the outcome by returning
an appropriate HTTP status code. The HTTP status codes used by this API method are described in the
following table:

[options="header"]
|===============================================================
| HTTP Status Code | Description
| 201 | A new message was created successfully.
| 400 | A new message was not created because validation failed.
|===============================================================

After our REST API has created a new message, it returns the information of the
created message as JSON. The returned HTTP response looks as follows:

include::{snippets}/create-message-success/http-response.adoc[]

=== Validation Errors

When validation fails, our REST API returns the validation errors as JSON. This section describes all
validation errors that can occur when we create a new message by using invalid information.

==== Empty Message Text

We cannot create a message that has an empty message text. In other words, when we send the following
JSON document to our REST API:

include::{snippets}/create-message-empty-text/request-body.adoc[]

Our REST API returns the following HTTP response back to the client:

include::{snippets}/create-message-empty-text/http-response.adoc[]
